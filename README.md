LazySusan is a pluginable bot for turntable.fm. She's currently in her early
stages of development, so her plugin API could change.

## Setup

0. Install the dependencies

        pip install ttapi

    (This will work in the near future. For now you have to manually install
    [ttapi](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API/tree/python_ttapi).)


0. Copy lazysusan-sample.ini to lazysusan.ini.

0. Update lazysusan.ini to include your connection information as per [these
instructions](http://alaingilbert.github.com/Turntable-API/bookmarklet.html).

0. Launch lazysusan

        ./lazysusan
